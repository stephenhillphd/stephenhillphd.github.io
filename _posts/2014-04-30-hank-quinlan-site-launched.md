Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak, I have some newfound free time. The courses that I teach at the [University of North Carolina Wilmington] (http://uncw.edu) have moved fully online. Fortunately, I have quite a bit of online teaching experience and I only had one face-to-face class anyway. So the transition to fully online has, thusfar, been a smooth one. 

This site is hosted on GitHub as a GitHub Page and is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I'm adding content using Markdown. A huge thanks to Johnathan McGlone for his easy to follow guide: [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub] (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
