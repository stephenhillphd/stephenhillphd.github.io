On March 12, 2020 the NCAA officially announced that both the Men's and Women's NCAA Basketball Tournaments would be cancelled for the 2019-2020 season. 
This announcement came amid an avalanche of notifications from sports leagues across the United States that seasons were to be suspended or cancelled. 

For this simulation we use the final NCAA Men's Tournament bracket projection from Jerry Palm at CBS Sports. You can see his final projection [here](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/bracketology/). 
Each game of the tournament is simulated via What If Sports SimMatchup tool. If you would like to simulate games yourself (for a variety of sports), you can find SimMatchup [here](https://www.whatifsports.com/ncaab/).
Today we look at the "First Four" play-in games that would have taken place March 17th and 18th in Dayton, Ohio. 

**(11) Wichita State vs. (11) Richmond**

**(11) Stanford vs. (11) UCLA**

**(16) Robert Morris vs. (16) NC Central**
NC Central knocks off Robert Morris 72-63 and advances to play overall Number 1 seed Kansas.  

**(16) Siena vs. (16) Prarie View**
