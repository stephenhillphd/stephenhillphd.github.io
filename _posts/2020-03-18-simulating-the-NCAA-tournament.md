On March 12, 2020 the NCAA officially announced that both the Men's and Women's NCAA Basketball Tournaments would be cancelled for the 2019-2020 season. 
This announcement came amid an avalanche of notifications from sports leagues across the United States that seasons were to be suspended or cancelled. 

For this simulation we use the final NCAA Men's Tournament bracket projection from Jerry Palm at CBS Sports. You can see his final projection [here](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/bracketology/). 
Each game of the tournament is simulated via What If Sports SimMatchup tool. If you would like to simulate games yourself (for a variety of sports), you can find SimMatchup [here](https://www.whatifsports.com/ncaab/).
Today we look at the "First Four" play-in games that would have taken place March 17th and 18th in Dayton, Ohio. 

**(11) Wichita State vs. (11) Richmond**
Wichita State overame a seven point halftime deficit to defeat Richmond 91-82. The Shockers advance to face the defending national champion Virginia Cavaliers. 

**(11) Stanford vs. (11) UCLA**
Stanford defeated UCLA 83-69 in a rare, early-round intra-conference matchup. UCLA led at the half, but collapsed in the final ten minutes. Stanford advances to face BYU. Note: To be honest, I'm not sure why Palm projected this matchup as it would have been easy to swap one of these teams with one from Wichita State/Richmond game. 

**(16) Robert Morris vs. (16) NC Central**
NC Central knocked off Robert Morris 72-63 and advances to play overall Number 1 seed Kansas. NCCU led by six at halftime and withstood a late Robert Morris rally.  

**(16) Siena vs. (16) Prarie View**
