**(1) Dayton vs. (16) Winthrop**  
It took a contested three-pointer from Dayton with 16 seconds left in regulation and a missed Winthrop three at the buzzer to send this contest into overtime and avoid only the second 16 Seed over 1 Seed upset in tournament history. Dayton survived overtime to win 98-92.   





**(5) Auburn vs. (12) Akron**  
The MAC champion Zips upset last year's Final Four participant Auburn 91-83. The Tigers closed to within two late, but could not complete the comeback.  

**(4) Louisville vs. (13) Liberty**  
The Flames upset Louisville 74-72 to move on to the Second Round. A shot from just inside the three-point line at the buzzer capped off the upset.  

**(2) Villanova vs. (15) North Dakota State**  
Villanova trailed North Dakota State by 14 at the half in a game that looked like it might be headed for a rout. However, a furious rally capped off by a three with less than 30 seconds remaining sent Villanova to the Second Round with 72-70 win.
