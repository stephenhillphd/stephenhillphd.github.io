**(1) Kansas vs. (16) NC Central**  
There would be no Cinderella magic today as Kansas handily defeated NC Central 76-49. The Eagles shocked the Jayhawks early by jumping out to a 10-3 lead, but Kansas responded and led by 13 at the half and further away in the second half.  

**(8) Arizona State vs. (9) Florida**    
Florida moves on with 70-57 victory over Arizona State. After moving out to an early lead, the Gators were never seriously threatened and easily ended the Sun Devils season.  

**(5) Wisconsin vs. (12) ETSU**    
East Tennessee shocked the Badgers, winning 100-87. Wisconsin trailed by three early in the second half before ETSU pulled away to win comfortably.  

**(4) Kentucky vs. (13) Vermont**  
The Wildcats escaped the Catamounts 72-69 in a game that was close throughout.

The Bearcats broke a tie with less than a minute to play and held on to knock off Illinois 91-87.  

**(3) Duke vs. (14) Little Rock**    
The Blue Devils avoided a First Round upset as they eliminated the Trojans 77-63. Little Rock was overmatched throughout and never looked likely to pull off the upset.  

**(7) Michigan vs. (10) Utah State**    
The Wolverines team that had looked so dangerous early in the season saw their appearance in the tournament end with a whimper as they fell 85-75 to the Mountain West conference tournament champions.  

**(2) Creighton vs. (15) Belmont**  
Belmont took at five point lead into the locker room at halftime, but Creighton dominated the second half, winning 85-65.
