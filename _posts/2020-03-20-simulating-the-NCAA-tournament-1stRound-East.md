**(1) Dayton vs. (16) Winthrop**    
It took a contested three-pointer from Dayton with 16 seconds left in regulation and a missed Winthrop three at the buzzer to send this contest into overtime and avoid only the second 16 Seed over 1 Seed upset in tournament history. Dayton survived overtime to win 98-92. 

**(8) St. Mary's vs. (9) Oklahoma**  
St. Mary's cruised to an 82-63 win over Oklahoma. The Gaels led by 12 early in the first half and were not threatened.

The MAC champion Zips upset last year's Final Four participant Auburn 91-83. The Tigers closed to within two late, but could not complete the comeback.

The Flames upset Louisville 74-72 to move on to the Second Round. A shot from just inside the three-point line at the buzzer capped off the upset.

Rutgers long-awaited appearance in the NCAA tournament continues for a second game as they defeated West Virginia 72-70.
