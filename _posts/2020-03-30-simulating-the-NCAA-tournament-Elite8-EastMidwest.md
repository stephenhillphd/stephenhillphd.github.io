**EAST**  
**(1) Dayton vs. (11) Rutgers**           
The Cinderella story continues! It was a long 29 years for Rutgers since their last tournament appearance, but they have made the most of it by advancing to the Final Four with an 89-75 victory over Dayton. 
Rutgers led by four at the half and slowly pulled away. Akwasi Yeboah led all scorers with 22 points. The Scarlet Knights make their second Final Four appearance in program history (1976).  

**MIDWEST**  
**(1) Kansas vs. (3) Duke**  
The Jayhawks advance to their 16th Final Four with an 88-79 victory over fellow college basketball power Duke. The Blue Devils led by four with just under eight minutes to play, but went cold from the floor to allow the Jayhawks to build a lead. 
Devon Dotson scored 23 in the loss.
