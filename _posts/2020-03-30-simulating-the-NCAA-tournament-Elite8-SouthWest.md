**SOUTH**  
**(1) Baylor vs. (3) Maryland**   
Maryland shocked the region's top seed Baylor, winning 86-79 to advance to the program's third Final Four. The Terrapins led by two at the half and after a back-and-forth second half, were able to secure the victory.
Anthony Cowan scored 30 for Maryland in the victory.  

**WEST**   
**(1) Gonzaga vs. (2) San Diego State**   
Gonzaga returns to the Final Four after an 85-76 victory over San Diego State. The Bulldogs were never really threatened in the second half as the Aztecs were only able to close within five.
