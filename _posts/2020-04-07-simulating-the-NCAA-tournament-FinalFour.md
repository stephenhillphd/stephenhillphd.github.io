This past weekend would have been college basketball's main event, the Final Four. On Monday night a champion would have been crowned.
However, due the Coronavirus pandemic, we were robbed of one of college sports' greatest moments. In this blog we have simulated the NCAA Tournament to, in a very small way, capture a little bit of the excitement that we missed out on.
In this post we present the Final Four and crown a simulated champion. WhatIfSports' SimMatchup tool is used for the simulation.  

**SEMIFINALS**
**Rutgers vs. Kansas**           
Rutgers jumped out early on Kansas, leading by as many as 15 and led 37-28 at the half. However, midnight came for the Cinderella Scarlet Knights. Led by Devon Dotson's 17 points, the Jayhawks rallied to an 82-68 victory, ending Rutgers' run. Ron Harper had 12 for Rutgers in the loss.
 
**Maryland vs. Gonzaga**  
Maryland led by six at the break (38-32) and extended their lead in the second half to win easily, 80-65. The Bulldogs got 14 from Filip Petrusev in the loss. Aaron Wiggins and Eric Ayala both had 16 to lead Maryland to their second ever national championship game.
